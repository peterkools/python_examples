### Project2

This project acquires the newest data from GDELT (a news categorization service), scores it using a public
scoring API from S&P Global and emits statistics about the scoring results.

This was designed as a proof of concept and is not a production example.

#### Operations

This project requires a Python3.7 virtual environment to run. It also requires an AWS
account. It will run either on MacOS or an EC2 instance.
